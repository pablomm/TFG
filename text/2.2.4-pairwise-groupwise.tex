We will define the pairwise alignment problem \cite{Srivastava2016} to deal with
the registration problem of two functions using a global criterion.

Let $f_1, f_2 \in \mathcal{F}$ be functional observations of a general space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $E: \mathcal{F} \times \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ an energy
functional. The alignment problem may be understood as the search of a warping
function $\gamma^*$ which minimizes the energy between the two functions, i.e.,
$\gamma^* = \operatorname{argmin}_{\gamma \in \Gamma} E[f_1, f_2 \circ \gamma]$.
When a warping $\gamma^*$ fulfills this property, we will say that $f_1$ is
registered to $f_2 \circ \gamma^*$. In the figure \ref{SBFIG:PAIRWISE1} it is
shown an example where two functions have been registered using this approach.

\end{figure}

To estimate $\gamma^*$, we will explore different paths that the
reparameterization may take in a discretized grid, trying to minimize the energy
term. In the appendix \ref{SEC:DPA}  it is described in detail the algorithm used for this
task, which is usually referred by several authors as dynamic programing
algorithm, or simply DPA [REF to DPA], because it makes use of this programming
technique to search the optimal path.



Given a set of functions $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^n \subset \mathcal{F}$, the
groupwise alignment problem will consist in the search of warping functions
$\{\gamma_i^* \}_{i=1}^n \subset \Gamma$ to align each of the functions with the
rest of them. To achieve this, we will build a target function $\mu$, also
called template, to which all the curves will be aligned. For instance,
the cross-sectional mean of the functions may be used as target.

A possible choice for the energy term would be to take
$E[f,g]= \|f - g\|_{\mathbb{L}^2}^2$, but
this criterion is not used in practice because three
problems will arise that will not make it adequate: the pinching effect, the
lack of symmetry and the inverse inconsistency \cite{Marron2015}.
