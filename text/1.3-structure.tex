The main part of the present document is divided into four chapters, aside from this introduction part. In the Chapter \ref{CAP:STATEOFART}, it is exposed the state of the art, which gives an overview of the mathematical framework of the functionalities developed to the package.

Chapter \ref{CAP:DESIGNDEV} summarizes the analysis and design of the functionalities added to the package, as well as the methodology and technologies used during the development of the work. To finish the main part, Chapter \ref{CAP:CONCLUSIONS} presents the conclusions of the work done along with a brief discussion about future work.

Besides, this document appends four annexes. Annex A contains proofs of some mathematical results set out in Section \ref{SEC:ELASIC}. These results have been moved to the annexes for the sake of clarity. Also, in the Annex B there are include more detailed descriptions of the different algorithms used.

Finally, Annex C includes a series of Python notebooks showing examples of the use of the functionalities incorporated, which have been thought to show in a pleasant way how to use the package to a new user. The documentation of the software developed has been include in the Annex D.
