The package contains a module for downloading datasets from different sources
as functional objects or the creation of synthetic datasets.
Among the methods created for the generation of datasets are included
\texit{make_sinusoidal_process}, which generates samples of the form
$f_i(t)=a_i\sin{wt + \phi_i} + e_i(t)$,
\texit{make_multimodal_samples}, which generates mixtures of gaussian-like
functions, such as those of the figure \ref{FIG:},
 or \texit{make_random_warping}, to generate sets of warpings functions like the
 those of the figure \ref{FIG:}.


 These synthetic datasets are useful for the generation of examples and the
 creation of tests, for this reason they have turned out to be fundamental
 during the coding and testing phase.
