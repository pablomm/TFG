So far, we have focused on the mathematical framework of the functionalities
incorporated into the package, however, most of the work was done during the
design, development and integration parts.

Although the package is currently at an early stage of development, it is
already beginning to be used by researchers in different countries, for this
reason, and to allow the expansion of the project, it has not only been
necessary the coordination of the team involved, but also special emphasis has
been placed on carrying out the development in a public and transparent way
and making a responsible integration of the new functionalities.
