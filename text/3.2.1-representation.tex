One of the most important changes carried out has been the creation of the
FData class, from which the existing FDataGrid and FDataBasis inherit,
designed to unify the API of the different representations. This class
implements general methods for evaluation, extrapolation, and plotting and
defines abstract ones common to all representations.

In addition, two submodules have been added,
\textit{interpolation} and \textit{extrapolation}, containing classes used during the
evaluation of functional data, implementing the concepts explained
in section \ref{SEC:REPRESENTATION}.
