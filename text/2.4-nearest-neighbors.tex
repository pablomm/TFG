The nearest neighbors estimators (NN-estimators) are a family of methods widely
used in statistics and machine learning, in problems of classification or
regression, among others. These estimators are based on the idea of
neighborhood, using the notion of distance, so that it is made a local
estimation of the density of a dataset.

Although in their classic version they are used with sets of vectors,
their ideas will work in the same way in general metric
spaces \cite{baillo2010}, as the functional ones we will work with.
