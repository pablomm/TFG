In FDA, the analyzed data might take the form of temporal series, curves, surfaces or anything else varying over a continuum.  The observations that will make up our data will come from random variables, whose realizations will take values in functional spaces, that is to say, they will be realizations of stochastic processes. For this reason, under this framework, we will consider them functions.

One may wonder what makes FDA different from multivariate analysis, considering the fact that data is generally collected and stored in the form of discrete point sets ${(t_j, y_j)}$ [Ref to functional and shape data analysis].  In multivariate statistics one works with the vector ${y_j}$, applying statistical methods and vector calculus to its study. However, FDA keeps the association of values ${y_j}$ and ${t_j}$, taking into account the functional nature of the data, allowing the study of the data using functional calculus.

In this chapter we will make an overview, from a theoretical point of view, of different FDA topics covered in this work.
