The aim of this work is to increase the functionality provided by the
\textit{scikit-fda} software package. The functionalities that will
be developed during this work may be divided into three main areas.

Firstly, interpolation techniques will be integrated with the existing
structures for the representation of functional data. These original structures
do not allow the evaluation of functional data as if they were functions,
which will be possible after the incorporation of the contributions of this work.

Secondly, tools will be created to the data registration. For this task
the books \textit{Functional data analysis}\cite{Ramsay2005} and
\textit{Functional and shape analysis}\cite{Srivastava2016} have been taken from
reference. As a result of these contributions, the package will provide an \ac{API}
to perform this step of the analysis.

To conclude, classification and regression models based on nearest neighbours
will be incorporated. For this purpose,
the estimators of the \textit{sklearn}\cite{sklearn} \acs{API} will be used as a reference,
incorporating an extension of these estimators for functional data
into the \textit{scikit-fda} package.
