The aim of this work is to continue the \textit{scikit-fda} project,
collaborating with in a general way in its development, but especially in the
registration of functional data, one of the areas of FDA, in which it is studied the
variability of the data due to its internal scale, such as time
in which a process unfolds.

Due to the extent of this area, it is not possible
to cover all techniques in this field, therefore the purpose of this work was
not delimited from the beginning in a clear way.
It was decided to start with techniques
exposed in the book \textit{Functional data analysis}\cite{Ramsay2005},
which makes a general overview of different
aspects in FDA, but without a clear goal on the specific
aspects to be dealt with.

For this reason, weekly meetings were scheduled throughout the year with all the
team involved in the project, to review the scope of this work and the next
steps to follow in its development, with the goal in mind to contribute as much
as possible to the growth of this project.
