Sometimes it is necessary to control the amount of elasticity during the
registration process, for this purpose it is possible to add a penalty term
$\mathcal{R}(\lambda)$ to the elastic distance.

Given $\lambda > 0$ and two SRSFs $q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{L}^2$, we will define
the distance penalized elastic distance as

$$
d_{\lambda}\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right) \equiv \inf _{\gamma \in \Gamma}\left(
\| q_{1}-\left(q_{2} \circ \gamma\right) \sqrt{\dot{\gamma}}\right)\left\|^{2}+
\lambda\right\| \sqrt{\dot{\gamma}}-1 \|^{2} )^{(1 / 2)}.
$$

As an example, it is shown the result of the alignment of two functions with different penalties in the figure
\ref{FIG:PENALTY}.
