This module contains different scattered topics used during the analysis of
functional data. Specifically, it has been added a metrics submodule, which
contains functional metrics, among which there are the family of $\mathbb{L}^p$
metrics for multivariate functions, the Fisher-Rao distance or elastic metrics
based on the framework of section \ref{SEC:AMPPHA}.
