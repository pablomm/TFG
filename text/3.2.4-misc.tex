The miscellaneous module
module contains different scattered topics used during the analysis of
functional data. Specifically, it has been added a \textit{metrics} submodule, which
contains functional metrics.
These metrics are used in several machine learning models.
Among the distances added to this module are
the family of $\mathbb{L}^p$
metrics for multivariate functions, the Fisher-Rao distance or elastic metrics
based on the framework of the Section \ref{SEC:AMPPHA}, such as the phase or
amplitude distance.
