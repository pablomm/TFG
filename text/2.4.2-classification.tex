In the classification problem, the samples of the training set
$\mathcal{X}_i$ are associated to the labels $Y_i$ corresponding to their class.
Given a datum $x$, we will predict a new label using the majority class among
its neighbors, so that the predicted class will be

$$
\hat Y = argmax_j \sum_{\mathcal{X}_i \in k(x)} \mathbb{1}_{\{ Y_i = j\}}.
$$

It is possible to make a weighting vote, so that the closest neighbors will have
a greater weight, for example, using $w_i=1/d(\mathcal{X}_i, x)$, so that the
resulting label will be

$$
\hat Y = argmax_j \sum_{\mathcal{X}_i \in k(x)} w_i\mathbb{1}_{\{ Y_i = j\}}.
$$
