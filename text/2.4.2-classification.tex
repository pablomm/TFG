In the classification problem, the samples of the training set
$\mathcal{X}_i$ are associated to the labels $Y_i$ corresponding to their class.
Given a datum $x$, we will predict a new label using the majority class among
its neighbors, so that the predicted class will be

\begin{equation}{Classification prediction}
\hat Y =\underset{j}{\operatorname{argmax}} \sum_{\mathcal{X}_i \in k(x)} \mathbbm{1}_{\{ Y_i = j\}}.
\end{equation}

It is possible to make a weighting vote, so that the closest neighbors will have
a greater weight, for example, using $w_i=1/d(\mathcal{X}_i, x)$, so that the
resulting label will be
$
\hat Y = \underset{j}{\operatorname{argmax}}  \sum_{\mathcal{X}_i \in k(x)} w_i\mathbbm{1}_{\{ Y_i = j\}}.
$
