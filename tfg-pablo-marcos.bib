The aligned curves exhibit only amplitude variation, and the domain transformations, called warping functions, capture the phase variation in the original curves. In this article we precisely define a new type of registration process, in which the warping functions optimize the fit of a principal components decomposition to the aligned curves. The principal components are effectively the features that this process aligns. We discuss the relationship of registration to closure of a function space under convex operations, and define consistency for registration methods. We define an explicit decomposition of functional variation into amplitude and phase partitions, and develop an algorithm for combining registration with principal components analysis, and apply it to simulated and real data.},

abstract = {Constructing generative models for functional observations is an important task in statistical functional analysis. In general, functional data contains both phase (or x or horizontal) and amplitude (or y or vertical) variability. Traditional methods often ignore the phase variability and focus solely on the amplitude variation, using cross-sectional techniques such as fPCA for dimensional reduction and data modeling. Ignoring phase variability leads to a loss of structure in the data and inefficiency in data models. This paper presents an approach that relies on separating the phase (x-axis) and amplitude (y-axis), then modeling these components using joint distributions. This separation, in turn, is performed using a technique called elastic shape analysis of curves that involves a new mathematical representation of functional data. Then, using individual fPCAs, one each for phase and amplitude components, it imposes joint probability models on principal coefficients of these components while respecting the nonlinear geometry of the phase representation space. These ideas are demonstrated using random sampling, for models estimated from simulated and real datasets, and show their superiority over models that ignore phase-amplitude separation. Furthermore, the generative models are applied to classification of functional data and achieve high performance in applications involving SONAR signals of underwater objects, handwritten signatures, and periodic body movements recorded by smart phones.},

abstract = {Functional data analysis (FDA) is a field of Statistics in which the data considered are functions. This kind of data analysis takes into account that the underlying mechanism that generates the observations is a stochastic process. In this manner, it is possible to address some important questions (e.g. related to the continuity and smoothness of the functions measured) that tradi- tional multivariate analysis can not. Given that it is a relatively recent ?eld of study, the methods of FDA are not as widely known as those of multivariate analysis. Speci?cally, there are few software implementations of FDA tools available, mostly in MATLAB and R. However, these are not built following open-source schemes, which makes it di?cult to meke contributions to them. Up to this day there are not any packages for Functional Data Analysis in Python. Since Python is the language of choice for many data scientists and software developers, an implementation of FDA techniques in this programming language seems to be of some utility. Functional data analysis is a vast ?eld that keeps growing thanks to the work of numerous research teams around the world. That is why the aim of this project is not simply to design a FDA toolbox in Python but also to start an open-source project to which anybody can con- tribute. In this manner, the package can grow and be kept up to date even after the completion of this undergraduate thesis project. With these goals in mind, the fda Python project has been published in a public repository in GitHub. At the moment it includes basic FDA functionalities. In the long term we expect that it will become a comprehensive and widely-used toolbox for FDA.},

abstract = {We introduce a novel geometric framework for separating the phase and the amplitude variability in functional data of the type frequently studied in growth curve analysis. This framework uses the Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric to derive a proper distance on the quotient space of functions modulo the time-warping group. A convenient square-root velocity function (SRVF) representation transforms the Fisher-Rao metric into the standard {\$}\backslashltwo{\$} metric, simplifying the computations. This distance is then used to define a Karcher mean template and warp the individual functions to align them with the Karcher mean template. The strength of this framework is demonstrated by deriving a consistent estimator of a signal observed under random warping, scaling, and vertical translation. These ideas are demonstrated using both simulated and real data from different application domains: the Berkeley growth study, handwritten signature curves, neuroscience spike trains, and gene expression signals. The proposed method is empirically shown to be be superior in performance to several recently published methods for functional alignment.},

abstract = {Constructing generative models for functional observations is an important task in statistical func- tion analysis. In general, functional data contains both phase (or x or horizontal) and amplitude (or y or vertical) variability. Traditional methods often ignore the phase variability and focus solely on the amplitude variation, using cross-sectional techniques such as functional principal component analysis for dimensional reduction and regression for data modeling. Ignoring phase variability leads to a loss of structure in the data, and inefficiency in data models. Moreover, most methods use a “pre-processing” alignment step to remove the phase-variability; without considering a more natural joint solution. This dissertation presents three approaches to this problem. The first relies on separating the phase (x-axis) and amplitude (y-axis), then modeling these components using joint distributions. This separation in turn, is performed using a technique called elastic alignment of functions that involves a new mathematical representation of functional data. Then, using individual principal components, one for each phase and amplitude components, it imposes joint probability models on principal coefficients of these components while respecting the nonlinear geometry of the phase representation space. The second combines the phase-variability into the objective function for two component analysis methods, functional principal component analysis and functional principal least squares. This creates a more complete solution, as the phase-variability is removed while simultaneously extracting the components. The third approach combines the phase-variability into the functional linear regression model and then extends the model to logistic and multinomial logistic regression. Through incorporating the phase-variability a more parsimonious regression model is obtained and therefore, more accurate prediction of observations is achieved. These models then are easily extended from functional data to curves (which are essentially functions in R2) to perform regression with curves as predictors. These},

This is referred to as dynamic time warping in the engineering literature. In effect, this conceptualizes variation among functions as being composed of two aspects: horizontal and vertical, or domain and range.

It also extends current inferential capabilities for unregistered data by providing a flexible probabilistic framework that 1) allows for functional prediction in the context of registration and 2) can be adapted to include smoothing and registration in one model. The proposed inferential framework is a Bayesian hierarchical model where the registered functions are modeled as Gaussian processes. To address the computational demands of inference in high-dimensional Bayesian models, we propose an adapted form of the variational Bayes algorithm for approximate inference that performs similarly to MCMC sampling methods for well-defined problems. The efficiency of the adapted variational Bayes (AVB) algorithm allows variability in a predicted registered, warping, and unregistered function to be depicted separately via bootstrapping. Temperature data related to the el-ni$\backslash${\~{}}no phenomenon is used to demonstrate the unique inferential capabilities for prediction provided by this model.},

It presents those parts of the theory which are especially useful in calculations and stresses the representation of splines as linear combinations of B-splines. After two chapters summarizing polynomial approximation, a rigorous discussion of elementary spline theory is given involving linear, cubic and parabolic splines. The computational handling of piecewise polynomial functions (of one variable) of arbitrary order is the subject of chapters VII and VIII, while chapters IX, X, and XI are devoted to B-splines. The distances from splines with fixed and with variable knots is discussed in chapter XII. The remaining five chapters concern specific approximation methods, interpolation, smoothing and least-squares approximation, the solution of an ordinary differential equation by collocation, curve fitting, and surface fitting. The present text version differs from the original in several respects. The book is now typeset (in plain TeX), the Fortran programs now make use of Fortran 77 features. The figures have been redrawn with the aid of Matlab, various errors have been corrected, and many more formal statements have been provided with proofs. Further, all formal statements and equations have been numbered by the same numbering system, to make it easier to find any particular item. A major change has occured in Chapters IX-XI where the B-spline theory is now developed directly from the recurrence relations without recourse to divided differences. This has brought in knot insertion as a powerful tool for providing simple proofs concerning the shape-preserving properties of the B-spline series.},

abstract = {This textbook for courses on function data analysis and shape data analysis describes how to define, compare, and mathematically represent shapes, with a focus on statistical modeling and inference. It is aimed at graduate students in analysis in statistics, engineering, applied mathematics, neuroscience, biology, bioinformatics, and other related areas. The interdisciplinary nature of the broad range of ideas covered—from introductory theory to algorithmic implementations and some statistical case studies—is meant to familiarize graduate students with an array of tools that are relevant in developing computational solutions for shape and related analyses. These tools, gleaned from geometry, algebra, statistics, and computational science, are traditionally scattered across different courses, departments, and disciplines; Functional and Shape Data Analysis offers a unified, comprehensive solution by integrating the registration problem into shape analysis, better preparing graduate students for handling future scientific challenges. Recently, a data-driven and application-oriented focus on shape analysis has been trending. This text offers a self-contained treatment of this new generation of methods in shape analysis of curves. Its main focus is shape analysis of functions and curves—in one, two, and higher dimensions—both closed and open. It develops elegant Riemannian frameworks that provide both quantification of shape differences and registration of curves at the same time. Additionally, these methods are used for statistically summarizing given curve data, performing dimension reduction, and modeling observed variability. It is recommended that the reader have a background in calculus, linear algebra, numerical analysis, and computation.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews some of the circumstances in which screening processes are used for classifying large numbers of entities into two or more final classes. It discusses various types of entity, ranging from chemical compounds to human beings, according to their constancy or mutability of character between successive stages. It presents two main types of screening, polytomous and regarded. In practical circumstances, some combinations of these are used, but the mathematical consequence of such a combination is very complicated and improved statistical techniques are needed before realistic analysis is possible. The chapter also discusses some of the ideas on screening of chemical compounds for therapeutic activity developed by Davies and Dunnett. Compared with these are the screening of crop varieties, screening in education, and screening based upon a multivariate criterion such as is often used in animal breeding.},

@article{Srivastava2011,
abstract = {We introduce a novel geometric framework for separating the phase and the amplitude variability in functional data of the type frequently studied in growth curve analysis. This framework uses the Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric to derive a proper distance on the quotient space of functions modulo the time-warping group. A convenient square-root velocity function (SRVF) representation transforms the Fisher-Rao metric into the standard {\$}\backslashltwo{\$} metric, simplifying the computations. This distance is then used to define a Karcher mean template and warp the individual functions to align them with the Karcher mean template. The strength of this framework is demonstrated by deriving a consistent estimator of a signal observed under random warping, scaling, and vertical translation. These ideas are demonstrated using both simulated and real data from different application domains: the Berkeley growth study, handwritten signature curves, neuroscience spike trains, and gene expression signals. The proposed method is empirically shown to be be superior in performance to several recently published methods for functional alignment.},

@techreport{Lyche2005,
abstract = {In this first chapter we consider the following fundamental problem: Given a set of points in the plane, determine a smooth curve that approximates the points. The algorithm for determining the curve from the points should be well suited for implementation on a computer. That is, it should be efficient and it should not be overly sensitive to roundoff errors in the computations. We only consider methods that involve a relatively small number of elementary arithmetic operations; this ensures that the methods are efficient. The sensitivity of the methods to round-off errors is controlled by insisting that all the operations involved should amount to forming weighted averages of the given points. This has the added advantage that the constructions are geometrical in nature and easy to visualise. In Section 1.1 we discuss affine and convex combinations and the convex hull of a set of points, and relate these concepts to numerical stability (sensitivity to rounding errors), while in Section 1.2 we give a brief and very informal introduction to parametric curves. The first method for curve construction, namely polynomial interpolation, is introduced in Section 1.3. In Section 1.4 we show how to construct Bezier curves, and in Section 1.5 we generalise this construction to spline curves. At the outset, our construction of spline curves is geometrical in nature, but in Section 1.6 we show that spline curves can be written conveniently in terms of certain basis functions, namely B-splines. In the final section, we relate the material in this chapter to the rest of the book.},

abstract = {We suggest a classification and feature extraction method on functional data where the predictor variables are curves. The method, called functional segment discriminant analysis (FSDA), combines the classical linear discriminant analysis and support vector machine. FSDA is particularly useful for irregular functional data, characterized by spatial heterogeneity and local patterns like spikes. FSDA not only reduces the computation and storage burden by using a fraction of the spectrum, but also identifies important predictors and extracts features. FSDA is highly flexible, easy to incorporate information from other data sources and/or prior knowledge from the investigators. We apply FSDA to two public domain data sets and discuss the understanding developed from the study. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To our knowledge,  this  is  the  first  software  package  that  allows  a  complete  treatment  of  these  types  of  data  in Python, one of foremost programming environments in the machine learning and data science communities. The library provides support for the analysis of functional data either in a discretized form or in a basis representation.  The scikit-fda Python package incorporates tools for registration, outlier detection, smoothing, exploratory analysis, and visualization of the data.  Other modules in the library are devoted to dimensionality reduction, clustering, functional regression with both scalar and functional responses, and classification. At the current stage, the library is being extended to include additional features and functionalities available in other programming languages (e.g.  R), as well as current developments in the area.  The library has been designed to be user friendly, flexible, efficient, and comprehensive, so as to fulfill the needs of statisticians, machine learning practitioners, and data scientists alike.},
